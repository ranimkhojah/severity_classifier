1;Commission;CAEM produces a lateral motion request when there is no hazardous collision object in the vicinity.;"""Sharp downhill curve with low friction and a bicycle riding in the same direction""";"""CAEM produces a lateral motion request causing the vehicle to swerve unnecessarily, potentially causing a collision with the bicycle""";S2; The hazardous event involves a potential collision with a bicycle due to an unnecessary swerve caused by CAEM. Given the nature of the event, the cyclist is an unprotected road user and is at a high risk of severe and life-threatening injuries, especially if the vehicle is moving at a high speed. The impact speed, in this case, can be high due to the unexpected swerve, increasing the severity of potential harm. Therefore, the severity is predicted as S2.

This is based on the scenario where the CAEM produces a lateral motion request causing the vehicle to swerve unnecessarily, potentially causing a collision with a tree. Given the nature of the event, it is similar to the example provided for S2 severity class - ""Side impact with a narrow stationary object, e.g. passenger car crashing into a tree (impact to passenger cell) with low speed"". The impact speed is assumed to be low as there is no indication of high speed in the scenario. However, the severity could be higher if there are unprotected road users such as pedestrians or cyclists nearby at the time of the accident."
3;Commission;CAEM produces a lateral motion request when there is no hazardous collision object in the vicinity.;"""Sharp downhill curve with low friction and a car parked illegally on the road""";"""CAEM produces a lateral motion request causing the vehicle to swerve unnecessarily, potentially causing a collision with the parked car""";S1; The severity of the hazardous event is predicted as S1, indicating light and moderate injuries. This is based on the scenario where CAEM produces a lateral motion request causing the vehicle to swerve unnecessarily, potentially causing a collision with a parked car. Given the nature of the event, the impact speed is likely to be low as it involves a parked car, and the persons involved would likely be the driver or passengers of the ego vehicle. The severity is not higher as the collision is not with a moving vehicle or a narrow stationary object at high speed, which would lead to more severe injuries.

Given the unprotected nature of pedestrians and the potential high impact speed, this could result in life-threatening injuries or even fatality, hence the severity is predicted as S3.
5;Omission;CAEM fails to produce a lateral motion request when it is necessary to avoid a collision.;"""Sharp downhill curve with low friction due to wet road conditions and a car parked on the side""";"""CAEM fails to produce a lateral motion request causing the vehicle to collide with the parked car""";S1; The CAEM failure causing the vehicle to collide with a parked car would most likely result in light to moderate injuries. This is because the impact speed would be relatively low given that the vehicle is not being propelled laterally at high speeds, and the parked car would absorb some of the impact. Furthermore, the vehicle's safety systems (airbags, seatbelts) would also mitigate the severity of the injuries.
6;Omission;CAEM fails to produce a lateral motion request when it is necessary to avoid a collision.;"""Sharp downhill curve with low friction due to wet road conditions and debris on the road""";"""CAEM fails to produce a lateral motion request causing the vehicle to collide with the debris""";S1;" The severity of the hazardous event where ""CAEM fails to produce a lateral motion request causing the vehicle to collide with the debris"" is predicted as S1. This is because, as per the provided severity classes, the collision with debris due to the failure of CAEM to produce a lateral motion request can be equated to a side impact with a narrow stationary object (the debris) at a very low speed. This is assuming that the vehicle was not at a high speed when the event occurred. Therefore, the severity is likely to result in light and moderate injuries, which falls under the S1 category."
7;Commission;CAEM produces a lateral motion request when there is no hazardous collision object in the vicinity.;"""Approaching a T-intersection with signalized pedestrian crosswalks on a multi-lane street and a bicycle is crossing""";"""CAEM produces a lateral motion request causing the vehicle to swerve into a parked car""";S1;The severity of the hazardous event where CAEM produces a lateral motion request causing the vehicle to swerve into a parked car is predicted as S1. This is because the event involves a collision with a stationary object (parked car) at a potentially low speed, which may lead to light and moderate injuries. The impact speed is likely not high enough to cause severe or life-threatening injuries, as the vehicle is swerving rather than directly colliding at high speed. However, the severity could be higher if there are unprotected road users nearby or passengers in the parked car.
8;Commission;CAEM produces a lateral motion request when there is no hazardous collision object in the vicinity.;"""Intersection with stop signs, a truck approaching from the left""";"""CAEM produces a lateral motion request causing the vehicle to swerve into the path of the truck""";S3; The severity of the hazardous event is predicted as S3 due to the high potential for life-threatening injuries or fatal injuries. The CAEM's lateral motion request causing the vehicle to swerve into the path of the truck could lead to a side impact with the truck, which is a large stationary object. This could cause a high level of harm to the driver or passengers of the vehicle, especially if the impact speed is high. The severity is therefore determined by the person with the highest level of severity, which in this case would likely be the driver or passengers of the vehicle.
9;Commission;CAEM produces a lateral motion request when there is no hazardous collision object in the vicinity.;"""Intersection with stop signs, debris on the road""";"""CAEM produces a lateral motion request causing the vehicle to swerve unnecessarily""";S1; The hazardous event involves CAEM producing a lateral motion request causing the vehicle to swerve unnecessarily. Considering the nature of the event, the severity is likely to be S1 as it may result in light and moderate injuries due to sudden swerving. The impact speed is not explicitly high, and there is no direct collision mentioned. However, the sudden swerve might cause discomfort or minor injuries to the passengers or driver of the ego vehicle. The severity is not higher because there's no mention of a collision with other vehicles or pedestrians, and the passenger compartment deformation is unlikely in this scenario.

This could result in life-threatening injuries (survival uncertain), or even fatal injuries, especially if the impact speed is high, which is likely in this scenario. This is similar to the example given for S3 severity level, where a front collision with passenger compartment deformation occurs.
11;Commission;CAEM produces a lateral motion request when there is no hazardous collision object in the vicinity.;"""Transiting an underpass on a wet multi-lane curved road with low friction, a car suddenly brakes in front""";"""CAEM produces a lateral motion request causing the ego vehicle to swerve into the next lane""";S1; The severity of the hazardous event, where CAEM produces a lateral motion request causing the ego vehicle to swerve into the next lane, is predicted as S1. This is because the event involves a sudden change in the vehicle's direction, which could potentially lead to a collision with another vehicle or roadside infrastructure, causing light to moderate injuries. However, the severity may not escalate to S2 or S3 as the impact speed might not be high enough to cause severe or life-threatening injuries, given that the event is triggered by a lateral motion request and not a high-speed chase or a head-on collision scenario.
12;Omission;CAEM fails to produce a lateral motion request when it is necessary to avoid a collision.;"""Transiting an underpass on a wet multi-lane curved road with low friction, a cyclist suddenly crosses""";"""CAEM fails to produce a lateral motion request causing a collision with the cyclist""";S2; The severity of the accident is predicted as S2 because the CAEM failing to produce a lateral motion request would likely result in a collision with a cyclist, an unprotected road user. Given the nature of the accident and the vulnerability of the cyclist, severe and life-threatening injuries are probable, but survival is still likely. This prediction is also based on the assumption that the impact speed is low, considering the max allowed speed of the vehicles involved.
13;Commission;CAEM produces a lateral motion request when there is no hazardous collision object in the vicinity.;"""Transitioning from a bridge to a sharp uphill curve with a solid line marking and a pedestrian is crossing the road""";"""CAEM produces a lateral motion request causing the vehicle to swerve towards the pedestrian""";S3; The hazardous event involves a vehicle swerving towards a pedestrian, which is an unprotected road user. Given the sudden lateral motion request produced by CAEM, the impact speed could be high. This scenario may result in life-threatening injuries (survival uncertain) or fatal injuries to the pedestrian, hence the severity is predicted as S3.
14;Omission;CAEM fails to produce a lateral motion request when it is necessary to avoid a collision.;"""Approaching a roundabout with debris on the road""";"""CAEM fails to produce a lateral motion request, leading to a collision with the debris""";S1;" The severity of the hazardous event where ""CAEM fails to produce a lateral motion request, leading to a collision with the debris"" is predicted as S1. This is based on the assumption that the debris collision would be similar to a side impact with a narrow stationary object at very low speed, which is an example given for S1 severity class. The impact speed is predicted to be low due to the failure of the CAEM to produce a lateral motion request, suggesting that the vehicle was not in a high-speed scenario. The severity is not higher since the collision is with debris, not a pedestrian or another vehicle, reducing the potential for harm to persons involved."
15;Omission;CAEM fails to produce a lateral motion request when it is necessary to avoid a collision.;"""Driving on a wet road, passing a grade-separated intersection, a heavy object falls from a truck ahead""";"""CAEM fails to produce a lateral motion request, causing a collision with the heavy object""";S2;" The severity of the hazardous event where ""CAEM fails to produce a lateral motion request, causing a collision with the heavy object"" is predicted as S2, indicating severe and life-threatening injuries but survival is probable. This is due to the fact that the failure of CAEM to produce a lateral motion request can lead to a high impact collision with a heavy object. The impact speed in this scenario is likely to be high considering the failure of lateral motion which could have otherwise reduced the impact. This high impact speed can cause severe injuries to the driver or passenger(s) of the ego vehicle. However, survival is probable as the collision is with a heavy object and not with a moving vehicle or unprotected road user, reducing the chances of fatal injuries."
16;Commission;CAEM produces a lateral motion request when there is no hazardous collision object in the vicinity.;"""Approaching a T-intersection with yield signs, a motorcycle is coming from the opposite direction""";"""CAEM produces a lateral motion request causing the vehicle to swerve into the opposite lane""";S2; The hazardous event involves CAEM producing a lateral motion request causing the vehicle to swerve into the opposite lane. This could potentially involve a collision with an oncoming vehicle or unprotected road users in the opposite lane, leading to severe and life-threatening injuries, especially if the impact speed is high. The severity is therefore predicted as S2, indicating severe and life-threatening injuries with survival probable.
17;Omission;CAEM fails to produce a lateral motion request when it is necessary to avoid a collision.;"""Scenario: A car from the opposite direction crosses into the ego vehicle's lane""";"""Hazardous Event: CAEM fails to produce a lateral motion request, leading to a potential collision with the oncoming car""";S2; The CAEM failure to produce a lateral motion request could lead to a collision with the oncoming car. Given the potential for a front collision at a potentially high speed, severe and life-threatening injuries are probable. The severity is predicted for all involved parties - the driver and passengers of the ego vehicle and the oncoming car. The final severity value is determined by the person with the highest level of severity, which in this case is S2. The impact speed is estimated based on the scenario and the maximum allowed speed of the vehicles.

The severity is elevated due to the unexpected lateral motion of the CAEM, potentially leading to higher impact speed and thus, greater harm.
19;Omission;CAEM fails to produce a lateral motion request when it is necessary to avoid a collision.;"""Driving on a straight multi-lane road that transitions into a bridge with solid line markings and pedestrian sidewalks, a car from the opposite lane suddenly swerves into the ego vehicle's lane""";"""CAEM fails to produce a lateral motion request when it is necessary to avoid a collision with the swerving car""";S2;The CAEM's failure to produce a lateral motion request to avoid a collision with a swerving car could result in a side impact or rear/front collision with the other vehicle. Given the unpredictable nature of the swerving car, the impact speed could be low to medium. This could lead to severe and life-threatening injuries to the driver or passengers of both vehicles, as well as any unprotected road users nearby. However, with immediate medical attention, survival is probable, hence the severity is classified as S2.
20;Omission;CAEM fails to produce a lateral motion request when it is necessary to avoid a collision.;"""Driving on a straight multi-lane road that transitions into a bridge with solid line markings and pedestrian sidewalks, a large object falls off a truck ahead and lands on the road""";"""CAEM fails to produce a lateral motion request when it is necessary to avoid a collision with the fallen object""";S1; The CAEM's failure to produce a lateral motion request to avoid a collision with a fallen object could lead to a front collision with the object at a very low speed, which might result in light and moderate injuries (S1) to the driver or passengers of the ego vehicle. The impact speed and severity could be lower due to the possibility of the driver manually steering away from the object or the vehicle's automatic braking system activating upon detecting the obstacle.
21;Omission;CAEM fails to produce a lateral motion request when it is necessary to avoid a collision.;"""Vehicle entering a roundabout with debris on the road""";"""CAEM fails to produce a lateral motion request causing a collision with the debris""";S1;" The severity of the hazardous event where ""CAEM fails to produce a lateral motion request causing a collision with the debris"" is predicted as S1, indicating light to moderate injuries. This is because the accident involves a collision with debris, not with another vehicle or pedestrian, and it is assumed that the impact speed is relatively low given the lack of a lateral motion request. The severity could be higher if the debris is large or the vehicle is moving at a high speed, but without additional information, the severity is estimated to be at the lower end of the scale."

This is because the event describes a failure of the system to initiate a lateral motion to avoid debris, but it does not explicitly state that a collision occurred. Therefore, in this scenario, it is assumed that the vehicle might have continued in its path without colliding with the debris or any other object, resulting in no injuries. The impact speed is not a factor in this scenario as no collision is explicitly mentioned."

This is because the impact speed would be relatively low due to the vehicle's inability to swerve, and the collision would likely be with a stationary object, similar to a passenger car crashing into a tree at very low speed. However, the severity could be higher if there are unprotected road users nearby or if the fallen object is large or heavy.

This is because the event describes a situation where the vehicle collides with debris, which can be considered a stationary object. The severity of the impact is likely to be light to moderate, as the debris is unlikely to cause significant deformation to the passenger compartment. The impact speed is also likely to be low, as the scenario does not specify any high-speed conditions. Therefore, the severity is assigned to S1, which represents light and moderate injuries."

This scenario falls under severity class S1 as it would likely cause light to moderate injuries, similar to a passenger car crashing into a stationary object at very low speed. The impact speed would be low due to the vehicle's inability to execute a lateral motion, hence the severity is not higher.

This is because the failure to produce a lateral motion request could result in a collision with the rock, which might cause light to moderate injuries depending on the impact speed. However, it is unlikely to cause severe or life-threatening injuries as the ego vehicle would not be colliding with another vehicle or unprotected road user, and the impact speed would likely be lower than in scenarios involving other moving vehicles. The severity is not S0 as there could be damage to the vehicle and potential injuries to the occupants."

However, the sudden swerve could potentially cause light to moderate injuries to the occupants of the vehicle due to the abrupt change in motion.
230;Commission;CAEM produces a lateral motion request when there is no hazardous collision object in the vicinity.;"""Scenario: A speed limit sign is on the side of the downhill road""";"""CAEM produces a lateral motion request causing the vehicle to swerve into another lane when there was no need to avoid the sign""";S1; The severity of the hazardous event is predicted as S1 as the CAEM's unnecessary lateral motion request causing the vehicle to swerve into another lane could result in a collision with another vehicle. However, considering the scenario doesn't specify high impact speed or a collision with a stationary object, it is unlikely to cause severe or life-threatening injuries. Therefore, the severity is classified as S1, indicating light to moderate injuries.
231;Commission;CAEM produces a lateral motion request when there is no hazardous collision object in the vicinity.;"""Traversing a gentle curve on a single-lane uphill road with an adjacent parking lane and a pedestrian crossing the road""";"""CAEM produces a lateral motion request causing the vehicle to swerve into the parking lane when there is no hazardous collision object in the vicinity""";S0; The severity of the hazardous event is predicted as S0 as the CAEM's lateral motion request causes the vehicle to swerve into the parking lane where there are no hazardous collision objects in the vicinity. Therefore, the potential harm is minimal with no injuries, similar to leaving the road without collision or rollover.
232;Commission;CAEM produces a lateral motion request when there is no hazardous collision object in the vicinity.;"""Traversing a gentle curve on a single-lane uphill road with an adjacent parking lane and a bus approaching from opposite direction""";"""CAEM produces a lateral motion request causing the vehicle to swerve into the bus when there is no hazardous collision object in the vicinity""";S1;The hazardous event involves a lateral motion request causing the vehicle to swerve into a bus, however, as there is no hazardous collision object in the vicinity, the impact speed would be relatively low. The individuals involved would likely be the driver and passengers of the ego vehicle and the bus. Given the low impact speed and lack of hazardous collision objects, injuries are likely to be light to moderate, falling under severity class S1.

However, since there is no hazardous collision object in the vicinity, the impact speed is likely to be very low, resulting in light to moderate injuries.
234;Commission;CAEM produces a lateral motion request when there is no hazardous collision object in the vicinity.;"""Driving on a multi-lane wet road with low friction, passing through a grade-separated intersection using an overpass with debris in the road""";"""CAEM produces a lateral motion request when there is no hazardous collision object in the vicinity, causing the vehicle to swerve to avoid the non-existent object and potentially collide with the debris""";S1; The severity of the hazardous event is predicted as S1 because the vehicle's swerving action, due to a false alarm from the CAEM, might lead to a collision with debris. This could result in light to moderate injuries, especially if the vehicle is moving at a low speed. The impact speed is predicted to be low as there is no actual hazardous collision object in the vicinity, and the collision, if any, would be with the debris on the road.

A bicycle is coming from the opposite direction""";"""Hazardous Event: CAEM produces a left lateral motion request when there is no hazardous collision object in the vicinity, causing the vehicle to veer towards the bicycle""";S1; The hazardous event involves an unexpected lateral motion of the vehicle towards a bicycle. Given that there is no hazardous collision object in the vicinity, it is likely that the impact speed would be low, leading to light or moderate injuries to the cyclist. This falls under the S1 severity class.
237;Commission;CAEM produces a lateral motion request when there is no hazardous collision object in the vicinity.;"""Scenario: Navigating a single-lane downhill road that transitions into a tunnel with a marked pedestrian crossing. A truck is parked on the side of the road""";"""Hazardous Event: CAEM produces a right lateral motion request when there is no hazardous collision object in the vicinity, causing the vehicle to veer towards the parked truck""";S1; The hazardous event involves the vehicle veering towards a parked truck due to a right lateral motion request with no hazardous collision object in vicinity. This scenario could potentially result in a side impact with the parked truck, which based on the severity classes, could result in light and moderate injuries (S1). The impact speed is not specified but considering that the vehicle was not initially heading towards any hazardous object, it can be inferred that the speed may not be high enough to cause severe or life-threatening injuries.
238;Commission;CAEM produces a lateral motion request when there is no hazardous collision object in the vicinity.;"""Scenario: Navigating a single-lane downhill road that transitions into a tunnel with a marked pedestrian crossing. A car is following the ego vehicle""";"""Hazardous Event: CAEM produces a left lateral motion request when there is no hazardous collision object in the vicinity, causing the vehicle to veer towards the following car""";S1; The hazardous event involves a sudden lateral motion of the vehicle due to a malfunction in the CAEM, causing it to veer towards a following car. However, the absence of a hazardous collision object in the vicinity indicates that the impact speed would be relatively low. This circumstance would likely result in light to moderate injuries to the driver or passengers of the ego vehicle or the following car. The severity is therefore classified as S1, assuming the use of safety measures such as seat belts and airbags.

This scenario aligns with the examples given for S1 severity, which include side impact with a narrow stationary object at very low speed. The impact speed is likely very low due to the absence of a hazardous collision object, and the persons involved are likely the driver or passengers of the ego vehicle.
