1;Omission;CAEM fails to produce a lateral motion request when it is necessary to avoid a collision.;"""Approaching a T-intersection with a debris on the road""";"""CAEM fails to produce a lateral motion request when it is necessary to avoid a collision with the debris""";S0;" The severity of the hazardous event where ""CAEM fails to produce a lateral motion request when it is necessary to avoid a collision with the debris"" is estimated to be S0. This is because the event describes a failure of the system to initiate a lateral motion to avoid debris, but it does not explicitly state that a collision occurred. Therefore, in this scenario, it is assumed that the vehicle might have continued in its path without colliding with the debris or any other object, resulting in no injuries. The impact speed is not a factor in this scenario as no collision is explicitly mentioned."
