This is based on the scenario where CAEM produces a lateral motion request causing the vehicle to swerve unnecessarily, potentially causing a collision with a parked car. Given the nature of the event, the impact speed is likely to be low as it involves a parked car, and the persons involved would likely be the driver or passengers of the ego vehicle. The severity is not higher as the collision is not with a moving vehicle or a narrow stationary object at high speed, which would lead to more severe injuries.

This is because the impact speed would be relatively low given that the vehicle is not being propelled laterally at high speeds, and the parked car would absorb some of the impact. Furthermore, the vehicle's safety systems (airbags, seatbelts) would also mitigate the severity of the injuries.

This is because, as per the provided severity classes, the collision with debris due to the failure of CAEM to produce a lateral motion request can be equated to a side impact with a narrow stationary object (the debris) at a very low speed. This is assuming that the vehicle was not at a high speed when the event occurred. Therefore, the severity is likely to result in light and moderate injuries, which falls under the S1 category."

This is because the event involves a collision with a stationary object (parked car) at a potentially low speed, which may lead to light and moderate injuries. The impact speed is likely not high enough to cause severe or life-threatening injuries, as the vehicle is swerving rather than directly colliding at high speed. However, the severity could be higher if there are unprotected road users nearby or passengers in the parked car.
6;Commission;CAEM produces a lateral motion request when there is no hazardous collision object in the vicinity.;"""Intersection with stop signs, a truck approaching from the left""";"""CAEM produces a lateral motion request causing the vehicle to swerve into the path of the truck""";S3; The severity of the hazardous event is predicted as S3 due to the high potential for life-threatening injuries or fatal injuries. The CAEM's lateral motion request causing the vehicle to swerve into the path of the truck could lead to a side impact with the truck, which is a large stationary object. This could cause a high level of harm to the driver or passengers of the vehicle, especially if the impact speed is high. The severity is therefore determined by the person with the highest level of severity, which in this case would likely be the driver or passengers of the vehicle.
7;Commission;CAEM produces a lateral motion request when there is no hazardous collision object in the vicinity.;"""Intersection with stop signs, debris on the road""";"""CAEM produces a lateral motion request causing the vehicle to swerve unnecessarily""";S1; The hazardous event involves CAEM producing a lateral motion request causing the vehicle to swerve unnecessarily. Considering the nature of the event, the severity is likely to be S1 as it may result in light and moderate injuries due to sudden swerving. The impact speed is not explicitly high, and there is no direct collision mentioned. However, the sudden swerve might cause discomfort or minor injuries to the passengers or driver of the ego vehicle. The severity is not higher because there's no mention of a collision with other vehicles or pedestrians, and the passenger compartment deformation is unlikely in this scenario.

This could result in life-threatening injuries (survival uncertain), or even fatal injuries, especially if the impact speed is high, which is likely in this scenario. This is similar to the example given for S3 severity level, where a front collision with passenger compartment deformation occurs.

This is because the event involves a sudden change in the vehicle's direction, which could potentially lead to a collision with another vehicle or roadside infrastructure, causing light to moderate injuries. However, the severity may not escalate to S2 or S3 as the impact speed might not be high enough to cause severe or life-threatening injuries, given that the event is triggered by a lateral motion request and not a high-speed chase or a head-on collision scenario.

Given the sudden lateral motion request produced by CAEM, the impact speed could be high. This scenario may result in life-threatening injuries (survival uncertain) or fatal injuries to the pedestrian, hence the severity is predicted as S3.

This is based on the assumption that the debris collision would be similar to a side impact with a narrow stationary object at very low speed, which is an example given for S1 severity class. The impact speed is predicted to be low due to the failure of the CAEM to produce a lateral motion request, suggesting that the vehicle was not in a high-speed scenario. The severity is not higher since the collision is with debris, not a pedestrian or another vehicle, reducing the potential for harm to persons involved."

This is because the accident involves a collision with debris, not with another vehicle or pedestrian, and it is assumed that the impact speed is relatively low given the lack of a lateral motion request. The severity could be higher if the debris is large or the vehicle is moving at a high speed, but without additional information, the severity is estimated to be at the lower end of the scale."

This is because the event describes a failure of the system to initiate a lateral motion to avoid debris, but it does not explicitly state that a collision occurred. Therefore, in this scenario, it is assumed that the vehicle might have continued in its path without colliding with the debris or any other object, resulting in no injuries. The impact speed is not a factor in this scenario as no collision is explicitly mentioned."

This is because the impact speed would be relatively low due to the vehicle's inability to swerve, and the collision would likely be with a stationary object, similar to a passenger car crashing into a tree at very low speed. However, the severity could be higher if there are unprotected road users nearby or if the fallen object is large or heavy.

This is because the event describes a situation where the vehicle collides with debris, which can be considered a stationary object. The severity of the impact is likely to be light to moderate, as the debris is unlikely to cause significant deformation to the passenger compartment. The impact speed is also likely to be low, as the scenario does not specify any high-speed conditions. Therefore, the severity is assigned to S1, which represents light and moderate injuries."

This scenario falls under severity class S1 as it would likely cause light to moderate injuries, similar to a passenger car crashing into a stationary object at very low speed. The impact speed would be low due to the vehicle's inability to execute a lateral motion, hence the severity is not higher.

However, it is unlikely to cause severe or life-threatening injuries as the ego vehicle would not be colliding with another vehicle or unprotected road user, and the impact speed would likely be lower than in scenarios involving other moving vehicles. The severity is not S0 as there could be damage to the vehicle and potential injuries to the occupants."
